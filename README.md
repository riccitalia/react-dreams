## React Dreams

A web application based on React's npx tool [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev).

### Description

This basic web application shows a pre-defined list of dreams. You can add your own dreams to the list, mark them as fulfilled/not fulfilled or delete them. Try it out on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/riccitalia/pen/KKdZVyZ)!

React is managing the list in a state array of objects.

### Learn

Visit my [website](https://riccitalia.com) and follow the tutorial on how to create this web application step by step.

### Recommendations

When I was starting to learn React I spent some hours and read the docs carefully. It's necessary to understand the concepts behind this framework and to become familiar with JSX.

There are two major sources to get started:
1. The official website of React: [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
2. The npx tool create-react-app: [create-react-app.dev](https://create-react-app.dev)

### Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/riccitalia/react-dreams.git
cd react-dreams
npm install
npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and start experimenting!

### Notes

This web application exists already with a similar style and functionality on [Glitch](https://glitch.com) using Node instead of React.
